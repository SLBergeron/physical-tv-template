Who We Are
PhysicalTV Studios is a creative media studio focused on how ideas take shape, move through culture, and create impact.
Led by Frederick Light, a creative director and entrepreneur with two decades in digital growth and media architecture, we build frameworks where story, strategy, and commerce align.
Our work focuses on the mechanics of attention - how ideas gain traction, build momentum, and endure.
What We Do
Three disciplines shape our practice:
Strategy. Story. System.
We align them to create continuity between what a brand says, makes, and becomes.
Our measure of creativity is simple: it must move something - in culture, in commerce, in the person who encounters it.

Why Clients Work With Us
Clients come to PhysicalTV for work that thinks.
We help them see the system around their ideas - how story meets market, how meaning scales.
Our services combine production and perspective, turning creative vision into commercial coherence.
Each framework draws on lived experience - decades spent building brands and communities that have reached billions. 
We work deliberately, and only where our presence can create momentum.

What We Offer
Three modes of work:
Consult. Create. Collaborate.
We advise on positioning, design creative systems, and partner in developing new ventures.
Whether it’s a podcast, a brand, or a product, the purpose stays constant: bridging the gap between intention and impact.
How It Works
We begin by listening - understanding context before direction.
We map the landscape to reveal what’s essential.
From there, we design the framework: the structure, story, and system that align a brand’s growth with its purpose.
Projects take one of three forms:
Advisory - strategic interventions for clarity and direction.
Studio Engagements - defined creative and production work with measurable outcomes.
Collaborations - ongoing partnerships built for sustained momentum.
Fees are structured around the scope and ambition of the work.
We keep a limited number of relationships to maintain focus and integrity.
If you feel our approach aligns, we’d like to hear from you.
